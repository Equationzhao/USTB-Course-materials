To illustrate what a problem this is: just last November a strain of E. coli was discovered in Chinese pigs to be resistant to colistin ? a last-resort antibiotic that has only been used in the US in the most dire cases of human infection, untreatable by all other antibiotics. In less than six months the CDC detected that strain of E. coli in a patient in Pennsylvania.</seg-source><target/></trans-unit><trans-unit translate="no" id="40fffe97-4588-451a-848f-ed7a1f07b5bf"><source> <x id="52"/><x id="53"/></source></trans-unit><trans-unit id="fa0bf96d-2d44-4b8b-9053-bc386a818a5c"><source>So why not just develop new antibiotics that the bacteria can’t resist?
